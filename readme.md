- Object-oriented programming  
- Functional programming  

This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable approach for their project requirements.

---

## 6️⃣ Python Syntax Overview

Python syntax is designed to be clean and readable. Instead of using complex symbols, Python relies on indentation to define program structure. This makes Python programs visually clear and easier to maintain.

---

## 7️⃣ Variables and Data Types

Variables in Python are used to store data values. Python automatically determines the data type based on the assigned value.

Common data types include:
- Numeric types  
- Text type  
- Boolean type  
- Sequence types  
- Mapping types  

Python’s dynamic typing makes it flexible and beginner-friendly.

## 8️⃣ Operators in Python

Operators are used to perform operations on values and variables. Python supports various categories of operators, including:
- Arithmetic operators  
- Comparison operators  
- Logical operators  
- Assignment operators  
- Membership operators  

---

## 9️⃣ Control Flow Concepts

Control flow statements determine the execution order of a program. Python provides mechanisms for:
- Conditional execution  
- Repetitive execution using loops  
- Flow control using keywords  

These features allow programs to make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently.

---

## 🔟 Functions and Modules

Functions are reusable blocks of logic that help organize programs into manageable sections. Modules allow grouping related functions and variables into separate files, improving code organization and reusability.

Python also provides a rich collection of built-in modules.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Python fully supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which helps in building structured and scalable applications.

Core OOP concepts include:
- Classes and objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  

OOP makes Python suitable for large and complex projects.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ File Handling Concepts

File handling allows Python programs to work with external files. Python supports reading, writing, and updating files, making it useful for data storage, logging, and report generation.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Exception Handling Concepts

Exception handling is used to manage runtime errors gracefully. Python provides structured mechanisms to detect errors and prevent program crashes, ensuring stable and reliable applications.

---
